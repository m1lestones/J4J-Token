# $J4J - Justice for Joey
## Dual-Chain Tokenomics & Launch Strategy

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

**Justice for Joey ($J4J)** is a community-driven meme token launching simultaneously on **Solana** and **Base**, created to raise awareness about government fraud and demand accountability. Named after "Joey," the fictional child that investigative journalist Nick Shirley used to expose Minnesota's alleged $9 billion daycare fraud scandal.

### Why Dual-Chain?

1. **Base:** Nick Shirley's official creator token ($thenickshirley) is on Base - ecosystem alignment
2. **Solana:** Largest meme coin trading volume, pump.fun infrastructure
3. **Maximum Reach:** Different audiences, different ecosystems, same message
